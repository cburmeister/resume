## Employment

### Discogs

*Senior Software Engineer* (Portland, Oregon), January 2013 - Present

Discogs is the largest online marketplace for music on physical media, with
over 59 million items for sale, supported by a cross-referenced
user-contributed database containing more than 14 million releases. I help
maintain an opinionated configuration of Kubernetes with a set of services and
integrations that enable other engineering teams to deploy containerized
applications.

Here are some of the other projects I've contributed to:

- An internal tool for tracking and responding to support requests (eventually
    migrating these tools to Freshdesk, then later Zendesk)
- Migrating a legacy Forum to MongoDB, then later to MySQL and Elasticsearch
    for full-text search and filtering/faceting capabilities
- Integrating the Discogs Marketplace with a variety of payment systems
    including PayPal's Express Checkout and Adyen's online payments platform
- An automated i18n process which continuously delivers up-to-date
    translations of our products in 9 languages from community sourced
    translators
- Implementing a value-added tax (VAT) collection and reporting system for the
    Discogs Marketplace
- An OpenID Connect certified OAuth 2.0 server providing authentication for all
    internal/external systems across the Discogs organization
- A federated GraphQL API as distinct microservices intended to replace the
    legacy REST APIs
- Using a change data capture pattern for breaking down a
    monolithic python application by shifting authorship of data to individual
    microservices using Debezium and Kafka Connect

### Blackline Consulting

Azure.

### Innova Apps
